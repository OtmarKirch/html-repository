<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a developer in the making. At the moment, I am HTML to make website. This is done in an online course at Udemy. I think it is a really good course. I enjoy it a lot.</p>

<p>In my previous life, I have done lots of differen things so far. I have been in the army, studying Aerospace Technology. After that, I studied political sciences. I became a dance instructor and studio manager afterwards. Effectively, I was leading the dance studio together with my colleague.</p>
